                    <b><em>Last Dance</em></b> is a dating app specifically designed for people over 60 years old who are looking for meaningful connections with other users.
                    Our goal is to create a safe and friendly space where users can meet new people to build romantic or friendship relationships, according to their preferences.
                    The platform is designed to offer personalized matches through advanced matching algorithms based on interests, location, and personal preferences.
                    Additionally, <b><em>Last Dance</em></b> prioritizes the safety and well-being of its users through verification systems, content moderation, and reporting of inappropriate behavior.

                <p>
                    To ensure data security, we use Firebase as a database to store user information and their activity within the app. Firebase allows us to manage data securely and efficiently, including user authentication, image storage, and real-time synchronization.

                <p>Additionally, we continuously work to improve our platform to ensure it is a safe and inclusive space for everyone. We implement measures against harassment, promote respectful interactions, and encourage open communication about privacy and digital security.</p>
                <p>If you have any questions about how we handle your information or need assistance, our support team is available to help you at any time.</p>

                <h3 id="enlaces-seguros">7.1 Secure links and warnings about links in private chats</h3>
                <p>
                    In <b><em>Last Dance</em></b>, the only links considered secure are those that redirect you to:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The <b>User Manual</b>, which you can access by clicking the corresponding button in the app's settings section.</li>

                    please note that <b><em>Last Dance</em></b> cannot guarantee the security of that link. Links shared
                    by other users may direct you to external websites that are not under our control, and they could contain
                    malicious or inappropriate content. We recommend being cautious when clicking on links shared by other
                    users and avoiding providing personal information on external websites.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you find a suspicious link or believe another user is sharing malicious links,
                    please report it immediately using the <b>Report User</b> feature in the app.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Although we implement security measures, no platform is completely infallible.
                    We recommend being cautious when sharing private information, such as images, videos, or messages,
                    as they could be accessible by other users if proper precautions are not taken.
                </p>

                <h2 id="retencion-datos">8. Data retention</h2>

                        that require data retention for a longer period
                        (e.g., compliance with tax audits, pending legal disputes, or fraud prevention measures),
                        we will retain the data only for as long as necessary.
